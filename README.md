# 2. Features

## (1) Local Deployment

## Prerequisites

Before starting deployment, ensure Docker Desktop is installed on your local machine. Arfni will automatically launch Docker Desktop if it's installed. If automatic launch fails, please start Docker Desktop manually.

### 1️⃣ Create New Project

In the local environment, click **Create New Project** to start the deployment process.

![image.png](/images/image%204.png)

---

### 2️⃣ Set Project Name and Folder

Configure the project name and the path where the project will be created.

![image.png](/images/image%205.png)

![local_3.png](/images/local_3.png)

---

### 3️⃣ Verify Generated Folder

Check the folder at the specified path. The `.arfni` folder and `stack.yaml` file will be automatically generated for deployment and canvas recording.

---

![image.png](/images/image%206.png)

---

### 4️⃣ Create Apps for Deploy

Create an `apps` folder and place your deployment files inside it. Each folder name should match the blocks used in the canvas.

![image.png](/images/image%207.png)

![local_3.png](/images/local_3%201.png)

---

### 5️⃣ Drag & Drop

Return to the canvas screen and drag & drop blocks according to the elements you want to deploy, placing them on the canvas.

![image.png](/images/image%208.png)

---

### 6️⃣ Change Properties

Click on each block to configure its properties. Set ports, environment configurations, and environment variables according to your architecture.

![image.png](/images/image%209.png)

![local_6.png](/images/local_6.png)

---

### 7️⃣ Check Stack.yaml

You can view the automatically updated `stack.yaml` file in the slide panel at the bottom. The file automatically saves when there are no changes for 2 seconds. After placing blocks and completing environment configuration, verify the `stack.yaml` file to prepare for deployment.

![image.png](/images/image%2010.png)

---

### 8️⃣ Deploy

Click the **Deploy** button in the upper right corner to start deployment.

![local_8_1.png](/images/local_8_1.png)

![image.png](/images/image%2011.png)

---

### 9️⃣ Deployment Process

### Deployment Stages

When you click the Deploy button, automatic deployment begins through 5 stages:

1. **Preflight** - Pre-deployment checks
2. **Generate** - Generate configuration files
3. **Build** - Build container images
4. **Deploy** - Deploy containers
5. **Health** - Health check verification

> Tip: You can stop the deployment at any time by clicking the Stop Deployment button.
> 

![image.png](/images/image%2012.png)

### Automatic File Generation

If required like `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` files are missing, they will be automatically generated. However, for deployment stability, it's recommended to configure these files in advance when possible.

### Deployment Optimization

The system will utilize existing images and deployments when available. If there are changes or new requirements, it will rebuild and install accordingly.

![local_9_2.png](/images/local_9_2.png)

### Deployment Completion

Once deployment is complete, a popup window will display:

- Which services were deployed
- What endpoints are available

![local_9_3.png](/images/local_9_3.png)

## Notes

- Arfni uses Docker for deployment, so Docker Desktop must be installed in your local environment
- If Docker Desktop is already installed, the system will automatically launch it
- If automatic launch fails, please start Docker Desktop manually - deployment will proceed automatically once it's running

![image.png](/images/image%2013.png)

## (2) Remote Deployment

## Prerequisites

Before starting remote deployment, ensure:

- SSH access to your remote server
- PEM key file for server authentication
- For Hybrid monitoring mode: Docker Desktop installed on your local machine

---

. 

![image.png](/images/image%2015.png)

Configure the following settings:

- **Server Name** - A friendly name for your server
- **Server Address** - IP address or domain name
- **Username** - SSH username
- **PEM Key Path** - Path to your SSH key file

![스크린샷 2025-11-12 133252.png](/images/%EC%8A%A4%ED%81%AC%EB%A6%B0%EC%83%B7_2025-11-12_133252.png)
